            Stress can be defined as any type of change that causes physical,
            emotional, or psychological strain. Stress is your body’s response
            to anything that requires attention or action. Everyone experiences
            stress to some degree. The way you respond to stress, however, makes
            a big difference to your overall well-being.it creates difficulty
            breathing ,panic attacks,sleep problems ,chest pains and high blood
            pressure etc.

            Overthinking
          </h2>
          <p className="leading-7 text-lg">
            Overthinking is defined as “a loop of unproductive thoughts” or “an
            excessive amount of thoughts that are unnecessary.” Overthinking can
            be harmful to our emotional health, especially when it’s directed at
            unwanted, spontaneous, negative thoughts, images, or memories.
            Fortunately, we can learn to curb this unhelpful way of thinking
            through greater self-awareness and the practice of mental
            disengagement.

          <h2 className="text-center text-3xl font-bold my-5">Depression</h2>
          <p className="leading-7 text-lg">
            Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious
            medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you
            think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression
            causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities
            you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical
            problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at
            home.
